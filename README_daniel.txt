-I used a template from HTML5UP (https://html5up.net/arcana)
-I uploaded the original main.css then copy-pasted my edited version in, so the changes can be seen through 'History'
-The main JavaScript element is the 'Fake Contact Form' under Contact
	-the non-framework JavaScript code I used is in email-validation.js
-I used tabs instead of 2-spaces for indentation

-I plan on using a variation of this website for actual usage, so the information there is true
